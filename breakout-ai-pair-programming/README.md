Hi! I want to create a game using React. I want it to be client-side only (no backend). It should a number guessing game. The computer will choose a random number between 1 and 100. The user will be able to make guesses up to a maximum of 5. The computer will let the user know if their guess was correct, too low, or too high. Please don't provide any code at this stage, just planning.
